== Debugging a StormCrawler Topology

Assuming you have a StormCrawler setup all ready to use (e.g., generated from the archetype), you can debug it by either:

* Running the Java topology from your IDE in debug mode.
* Using the following command to enable remote debugging:

[source,bash]
----
export STORM_JAR_JVM_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=localhost:8000"
----

Then run the topology in the usual way with `storm jar ...` and remote debug from your IDE.

In both cases, the topology will need to run in local mode, i.e., not deployed to a Storm cluster.
